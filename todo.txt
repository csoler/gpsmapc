Feature list
	[ ] automatically store maps
	[ ] exports Garmin GPS

Project components
	[ ] Map database. 
			* Contains all images into a directory. 
			* Images do not need to be aligned, but only have the same coordinate system.
			* A single xml file keeps the list of images and for each of them the image scale and the coordinates of one particular pixel

	[ ] Map accessor
			* reads the images in the database so that they can be arranged into the current window
			* generates an image of given size that can be displayed in the GUI, or that can be used to create GPS background tiles 

	[ ] GUI
			* allows to zoom and navigate through the maps, which are automatically loaded according to what's needed and the correct resolution
				and temporarily stored into a cache where multiple copies of the same maps exist at different sizes

			* mouse over indicates image name/Id and GPS coordinates

			* right-click export current view as a Garmin GPS background maps
				- asks for filename
				- split the window into small square tiles of size 1024x1024 and recopute the images by picking the pixels in the global map
				- exports the map as a directory containing all tiles, plus a kmz file

			* adding a new image can be done from the GUI using drag&drop. The image is added in the bottom left corner and the user can select 
			  a point in it and supply GPS coordinates for this point and the image scale, or two points and no scale.

			  When automatic registration is active, the image is first checked with existing images and automatically placed, or 
			  (if nothing found) left to the bottom left corner.

			* at start the GUI shows the whole set of images. The ones that are not registered yet are shows in a specific place. The user can click on them and
				supply GPS coordinates for a point, which moves the image to its right place
	
	[ ] Automatic registration
			* A SIFT-based image registration system automatically finds the relative position of all images in the database
			* the position of images is optimized to remove all apparent discontinuities
			* when a new image is added, GPS coordinates are automatically computed using the automatic registration system and left for the user to validate.

	[ ] IGN Accessor
			* Automatic DL missing images from internet. That is a bit more difficult to do, but probably possible.
